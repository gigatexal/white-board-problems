# two sum

take a 1-d array of integers (unsigned aka positive only) where integers can repeat and where two of the integers might add up to a target number that will be provided
return a container (struct, class, etc.) with the attributes:
- indexes: a set of the indexes - length 2
- found: a boolean set to true if found or false if not found

a folder called `data` exists to create some sample data. Data will be read from a text file `data.txt` in the `data` folder.

the first line of this file contains the integers and the second line contains the target.

TODO: what about making this data.txt file a json file which would be more akin to a schema with data than a simple data file...
